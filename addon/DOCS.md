# Home Assistant Add-on: HA Tunnel

## How to use

Install the Home Assistant Tunnel Server and then point your local installation
to the remote tunnel server. This way smart devices like Alex and Google Assistant
can talk to your Home Assistant instance without needing direct access to your
server.
